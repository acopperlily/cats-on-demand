# Cats On Demand
Cats may dominate the internet, but you can command the cats! Demand your dose of feline fun provided by Cataas (Cat as a Service) API.

## How It's Made

**Tech Used:** 
- ![cra](./src/icons/cra.svg) Create React App
- ![react](./src/icons/react.svg) React
- ![html](./src/icons/html.svg) HTML
- ![css](./src/icons/css.svg) CSS
- ![javascript](./src/icons/javascript.svg) JavaScript

This is a React project using Create React App. A fetch request to the Cataas API retrieves a random cat photo. If you wish, you can also include text to be displayed on the photo.

## Optimizations

Instead of relying on the API to render the text onto the image, I would like to create my own code in order to display text. That way I could have more control over how the message displays on the photo.

## Lessons Learned

This project underwent two different phases. COD was initially built for the purpose of learning how to retrieve and display data from an API. Then I overhauled the entire project while converting it into a React application.
