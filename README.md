# Cats On Demand
Do you demand cats? Users can request cats freshly served up by Cataas (Cat as a Service) API.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Fetch API

I implemented a fetch request to Cataas API to retrieve cat photos. Users can input text to be displayed on the photos.

## Optimizations

Instead of relying on the API to render the text onto the image, I would like to create my own code in order to display text. That way I could have more control over how the message displays on the photo.

## Lessons Learned

This project underwent two different phases. COD was initially built for the purpose of learning how to retrieve and display data from an API. Then I overhauled the entire project while converting it into a React application.

## Examples
Take a look at this example that I have in my own portfolio:
