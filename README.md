## How It's Made

**Tech Used:** 
- <img src="./src/icons/cra.svg" width="24"> Create React App
- <img src="./src/icons/react.svg" width="24"> React
- <img src="./src/icons/html.svg" width="24"> HTML
- <img src="./src/icons/css.svg" width="24"> CSS
- <img src="./src/icons/javascript.svg" width="24"> JavaScript

This cat meme generator is a React project built with Create React App. A fetch request to the Cataas API retrieves a random cat photo. If you wish, you can also include text to be displayed on the photo.

## Optimizations

Instead of relying on the API to render the text onto the image, I would like to create my own code in order to display text. That way I could have more control over how the text displays on the photo.

## Lessons Learned

This project underwent two different phases. COD was initially built for the purpose of learning how to retrieve and display data from an API. Then I overhauled the entire project while converting it into a React application.
